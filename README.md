Diff B/W Keras and TensorFlow:
---------------------------
Keras is best for beginners â€” itâ€™s simple, clean, and great for quick model building.
TensorFlow is better for professionals â€” itâ€™s powerful, flexible, and production-ready.

ðŸ‘‰ The ideal choice today is TensorFlow with Keras (tf.keras),
because it combines Kerasâ€™s ease of use with TensorFlowâ€™s speed, scalability, and deployment power â€” giving you the best of both worlds.
